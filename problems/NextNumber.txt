PROBLEM STATEMENT
The binary weight of a positive integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation. For example, the decimal number 1 has a binary weight of 1, and the decimal number 1717 (which is 11010110101 in binary) has a binary weight of 7.

Given a positive integer N, return the smallest integer greater than N that has the same binary weight as N.

DEFINITION
Class:NextNumber
Method:getNextNumber
Parameters:int
Returns:int
Method signature:int getNextNumber(int N)


NOTES
-The result is guaranteed to fit in a signed 32-bit integer.


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1717

Returns: 1718

Example from the problem statement.

1)
4

Returns: 8

4 is 100 in its binary representation and weighs 1. The next number is 1000(in binary) which represents 8.

2)
7

Returns: 11

The decimal 7 is binary 111, so it has binary weight of 3. The next number with the same binary weight is 11, which is 1011 in binary.

3)
12

Returns: 17

12 in decimal is 1100 in binary. The next number with the same binary weight is 10001 in binary, which is 17.

4)
555555

Returns: 555557
